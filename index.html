    <!-- About Me Section -->

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>  I am currently a Academic Associate at the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore, with research experience
at the University of Hyderabad, NIUA, and CDS-JNU. My interests include International Trade, Labour Economics,
and Development Studies, with a focus on how trade, structural reforms, and technological change shape labour
markets and development outcomes. 
 </p> <p> Recently, I have incorporated machine learning into my research, working with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This fusion of deep learning and mathematical modeling is improving the predictive power of solutions to nonlinear differential equations. Alongside this, I have explored fuzzy differential equations and developed mathematical models for SIRS epidemiological systems. These interdisciplinary efforts have helped bridge theory and application in areas like health.  </p> <p>  My academic journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from the University of Calicut, followed by a Master’s in Economics from the University of Hyderabad, where I graduated with first class. During my postgraduate studies, I was mentored by Dr. G. Vijay (Labour Economics) and Dr. G. Sridevi (Public Policy), which shaped my research interests in labour markets, development policy, and urban transformation.

I am currently working as an Academic Associate at the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore, where I have served as a Teaching Assistant for Microeconomics and Macroeconomics courses and audited PhD-level Econometrics-I.

Previously, I worked as a Research Associate at the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) on the project “Urban Jobs in Transition – The Phenomenon of Census Towns in Kochi,” where I analysed emerging labour market trends in urbanising regions.

My field-based research experience includes work on tribal livelihood security in Kumily, Idukki, with a focus on the gendered impacts of development interventions among the Mannan and Paliyan communities within the Periyar Tiger Reserve. I also interned at the Centre for Development Studies (CDS-JNU), collaborating with ANERT, KSEB, and government agencies for data-driven research on energy and infrastructure policy.

These experiences have shaped my research focus on the intersections of labour economics, public policy, and inclusive development, with a growing interest in the socio-economic impacts of technological change, urban transitions, and climate adaptation. </p>
